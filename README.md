`peacesciencer` is an R package including various functions and data
sets to allow easier analyses in the field of quantitative peace
science. The package is very much a work in progress. The goal is to
provide an R package that reasonably approximates what made
[EUGene](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0738894211413055)
so attractive to scholars working in the field of quantitative peace
science in the early 2000s. EUGene shined because it encouraged
replications of conflict models while having the user also generate data
from scratch. Likewise, this R package will offer tools to approximate
what EUGene did within the R environment (i.e.Â not requiring Windows for
installation).
