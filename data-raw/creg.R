# Country identifiers (COW codes): The values used were based on those in Gleditsch and
# Wardâ€™s list of independent states with two exceptions, post-USSR Russia and Post-
#   Yugoslavia Serbia. The changes in population data between the pre-breakup period and the
# post-breakup period were large enough that a separate country had to be created to make
# post-breakup estimations. The following COW codes were used:
#   Country Cowcode
# Years
# Serbia
# 340
# 1992-2013
# Russia
# 393
# 1991-2013
# USSR
# 365
# 1945-1991
# Yugoslavia
# 345
# 1945-1992
# The Gleditsch and Ward coding scheme for post-unification Germany and post-unification
# Yemen were used:
#   Country
# Federal Republic of Germany
# Yemen (Arab Republic of Yemen)
# Cowcode
# 265
# 678
# Years
# 1945-2013
# 1945-2013
