# Palestine/West Bank, Piedmont-Sardinia, Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, Serbia, Somaliland, W端rtemberg

# countrycode, great as it is, is going to struggle with a few cases:
# First, it's not going to know what to do with "Hesse-Darmstadt". This is Hesse Grand Ducal. NOT Hesse-Electoral
# Second: it's not going to know what to do with "Hesse-Kassel". This is Hesse Electorate. NOT Hesse Grand Ducal
# 3rd: it's not going to know what to do with "Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach." This is Saxony---I think---but Saxony is already represented. Let's ignore it.
# Fourth: It's not going to know what to do with "W端rtemberg". This is, well, W端rtemberg. ccode == 271.
# Finally: Serbia always throws it for a loop. Serbia == 345.
# Fifth, it doesn't treat Piedmont-Sardinia as the predecesor state to Italy, which CoW does (and it seems Vdem does too).
# I had a previous comment here about tripping up between ROV and Vietnam, but I think VAB fixed that in a recent update.

# oof...
# So, we'll have to go through this manually:
# Colombia/Gran Colombia in 1832: drop Gran Colombia. It was over in 1831, IIRC.
# Germany/West Germany in 1945: both are NA (no shit...) but West Germany didn't exist until the mid-1950s.
# Germany/West Germany in 1990: both are the same, but pick W Germany because it was there on Jan. 1.
# Sardinia/Italy in 1861: judgment call, but drop Italy in 1861 since unification happened that year.
# Serbia and S&M (sic) in 2006: drop Serbia, the rump state that emerged later that year.
# Yugoslavia gets duplicated in 1991. Both are -5. Just slice it at the end.
# USSR and Russia in 1922. Another judgment call and the distance is rather large. No matter, USSR emerged in Dec. 1922. Pick Russia.
# Ethiopia in 1993 gets duplicated likely because Polity codes a new state after the civil war. Pick where politycode == 530.
# Sudan and Sudan-North get duplicated in 2011, again because of a civil war. Pick where politycode == 625
# Vietnam and Vietnam North get duplicated because of unification in 1976. Both are the same. Just pick one.
