# Hmm. What is even going on here?
# If I understand the codebook correctly, this should not happen. The data are offered as monadic, country-year data.
# However, the litany of duplicates here suggest the data are extra-counting the country-years with onset episodes.
# France in 1946 seems illustrative here. There are four France-1946 observations, which would square with onset episodes
# with Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam. Likewise, Panama in 1989 has two observations, one for the United States
# and another for the failed coup attempt led by MoisÃ©s Giroldi.

# So, under those conditions, I am going to create a new sum variable that gets the total of new onsets.
# I think, then, in the spirit of simplicity, I'm going to group_by(gwcode, year) and *add* those duplicates
# together. What this will do is communicate the sum of new onsets with those specified windows from the codebook.

# This might create some other weirdness with the year_prev variable. In a lot of these applications, its 1815, but
# that's almost beside the point. The problem is, in the case of having to truncate duplicate observations, the year_prev
# variable can't be informative. I suppose one way around this is to collapse it into a string. I'm tempted to just drop it.
