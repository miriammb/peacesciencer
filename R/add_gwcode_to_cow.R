#' Add Gleditsch-Ward state system codes to dyad-year or state-year data with Correlates of War state codes.
#'
#' @description \code{add_gwcode_to_cow()} allows you to add estimates of democracy to either dyad-year or state-year data.
#'
#'
#' @return \code{add_gwcode_to_cow()} takes a dyad-year data frame or state-year data frame that already has Correlates of War
#' state system codes and adds their corollary Gleditsch-Ward codes.
#'
#' @details The \code{data-raw} directory on the project's Github contains more information about the underlying data that assists
#' in merging in these codes.
#'
#' The user will invariably need to be careful and ask why they want these data included. The issue here is that both have a different
#' composition and the merging process will not (and cannot) be perfect. We can note that a case like Serbia/Yugoslavia is not too difficult
#' to handle (since "Serbia" never overlaps with "Yugoslavia" in the Gleditsch-Ward data and Correlates of War understands Serbia as the
#' predecessor state, dominant state, and successor state to Yugoslavia). However, there is greater weirdness with a case like Yemen/Yemen
#' Arab Republic. The script will *not* create state-year or dyad-year duplicates for the Correlates of War codes. The size of the original data
#' remain unchanged. However, there will be some year duplicates for various Gleditsch-Ward codes (e.g. Yemen, again). Use with care. You can also use
#' the \code{countrycode} package. Whether you use this function or the \code{countrycode} package, do *not* do this kind of merging without assessing
#' the output.
