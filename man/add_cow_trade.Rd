\title{Add Correlates of War trade data to a dyad-year or state-year data frame}
\usage{
add_cow_trade(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a dyad-year data frame (either "directed" or "non-directed") or a state-year data frame}
}
\value{
\code{add_cow_trade()} takes a dyad-year data frame or state-year data frame and
adds information about the volume of trade in that given dyad-year or state-year. For the state-year
data, these are minimally the sum of all imports and the sum of all exports. For dyad-year data,
this function returns the value of imports in current million USD in the first country from
the second country (and vice-versa) along with their "smooth" equivalents.
}
\description{
\code{add_cow_trade()} allows you to add Correlates of War alliance
data to a dyad-year data frame
}
\details{
For the dyad-year data, there must be some kind of information loss in order to work within the
limited space available to this package. This package loads a truncated version of the data in which the trade
values are rounded to integers in order to greatly reduce the disk space for this package. I do not think this
to be terribly problematic, though I admit I do not like it. If this is a problem for your research question,
you may want to consider not using this function for dyad-year data.
