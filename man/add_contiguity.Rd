\title{Add Correlates of War direct contiguity information to a dyad-year or state-year data frame}
\usage{
add_contiguity(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a dyad-year data frame (either "directed" or "non-directed") or a state-year data frame}
}
\value{
\code{add_contiguity()} takes a dyad-year data frame and adds information
about the contiguity relationship based on the "master records" for the
Correlates of War direct contiguity data (v. 3.2). If the data are dyad-year, the function
returns the lowest contiguity type observed in the dyad-year (if contiguity is observed at all).
If the data are state-year, the data return the total number of land and sea borders calculated
from these master records.
}
\description{
\code{add_contiguity()} allows you to add Correlates of War contiguity
data to a dyad-year or state-year data frame.
}
\details{
The contiguity codes in the dyad-year data range from 1 to 6. 1 = direct land contiguity. 2 =
separated by 12 miles of water or fewer (a la Stannis Baratheon). 3 = separated by
24 miles of water or fewer (but more than 12 miles). 4 = separated by 150 miles
of water or fewer (but more than 24 miles). 5 = separated by 400 miles of water
or fewer (but more than 150 miles). 6 = separated by more than 400 miles of water (i.e.
not contiguous).

For additional clarity, the "master records" produce duplicates for cases when
the contiguity relationship changed in a given year. This function returns the
*minimum* contiguity relationship observed in that given year. There should be no
duplicates in the returned output.
