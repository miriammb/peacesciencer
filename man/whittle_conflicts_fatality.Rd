\title{Whittle Duplicate Conflict-Years by Highest Fatality}
\usage{
whittle_conflicts_fatality(data)

wc_fatality(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a data frame with a declared conflict attribute type.}

\item{...}{optional, only to make the shortcut work}
}
\value{
\code{whittle_conflicts_fatality()} takes a dyad-year data frame
or leader-dyad-year data frame with a declared conflict attribute type
and, grouping by the dyad and year, returns just those observations
that have the highest observed dispute-level fatality. This will not
eliminate all duplicates, far from it, but it's a sensible second cut
(after whittling onsets in \code{whittle_conflicts_onsets()} the extent
to which dispute-level fatality is a good heuristic for dispute-level
severity/importance.
}
\description{
\code{whittle_conflicts_fatality()} is in a class of
do-it-yourself functions for coercing (i.e. "whittling") conflict-year
data with cross-sectional units to unique conflict-year data by
cross-sectional unit. The inspiration here is clearly the problem
of whittling dyadic dispute-year data into true dyad-year data (like in
the Gibler-Miller-Little conflict data). This particular
function will keep the observations with the highest observed fatality.
}
\details{
Dyads are capable of having multiple disputes in a given year,
which can create a problem for merging into a complete dyad-year
data frame. Consider the case of France and Italy in 1860, which
had three separate dispute onsets that year (MID#0112, MID#0113, MID#0306),
as illustrative of the problem. The default process in \pkg{peacesciencer}
employs several rules to whittle down these duplicate dyad-years for
merging into a dyad-year data frame. These are available in
\code{add_cow_mids()} and \code{add_gml_mids()}.

As of writing, the Correlates of War and Gibler-Miller-Little conflict
data record some -9s for fatalities. In those cases, dispute-level
fatality is momentarily recoded to be .5 (i.e. fatal, but without too
many fatalities). This is a missing data problem that Gibler and Miller
correct in a forthcoming publication in \emph{Journal of Conflict Resolution}.
Until then, this function makes that kind of determination about
disputes with missing fatalities.

\code{wc_fatality()} is a simple, less wordy, shortcut for the same function.
