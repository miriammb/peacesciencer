\title{Add democracy information to dyad-year or state-year data.}
\usage{
add_democracy(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a dyad-year data frame (either "directed" or "non-directed") or a state-year data frame.}
}
\value{
\code{add_democracy()} takes a dyad-year data frame or state-year data frame and adds information
about the level of democracy for the state or two states in the dyad in a given year. If the data are dyad-year, the function
adds six total columns for the first state (i.e. \code{ccode1}) and the second state (i.e. \code{ccode2}) about the level
of democracy measured by the Varieties of Democracy project (\code{v2x_polyarchy}), the Polity project (\code{polity2}), and
Xavier Marquez' \code{QuickUDS} extensions/estimates. If the data are state-year, the function returns three additional columns
to the original data that contain that same information for a given state in a given year.
}
\description{
\code{add_democracy()} allows you to add estimates of democracy to either dyad-year or state-year data.
}
\details{
The function leans on attributes of the data that are provided by the \code{create_dyadyear()} or
\code{create_stateyear()} function. Make sure that function (or data created by that function) appear at the top
of the proverbial pipe.
