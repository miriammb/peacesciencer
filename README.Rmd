`peacesciencer` is an R package including various functions and data sets to allow easier analyses in the field of quantitative peace science. The goal is to provide an R package that reasonably approximates what made [EUGene](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0738894211413055) so attractive to scholars working in the field of quantitative peace science in the early 2000s. EUGene shined because it encouraged replications of conflict models while having the user also generate data from scratch. Likewise, this R package will offer tools to approximate what EUGene did within the R environment (i.e. not requiring Windows for installation).

The package is very much a work in progress. Right now, it has the following functions:

- `add_capital_distance()`: adds capital-to-capital distance (in kilometers, "as the crow flies") to dyad-year or state-year data.
- `add_contiguity()`: adds Correlates of War direct contiguity data to dyad-year or state-year data.
- `add_cow_alliance()`: adds Correlates of War major power information to dyad-year data.
- `add_cow_majors()`: adds Correlates of War major power information to dyad-year or state-year data.
- `add_democracy()`: adds estimates of democracy/levels of democracy to dyad-year or state-year data.
- `add_gwcode_to_cow():` adds Gleditsch-Ward state codes to dyad-year or state-year data with Correlates of War state codes.
- `create_stateyears()`: converts Correlates of War or Gleditsch-Ward state membership data into state-year format.
- `create_dyadyears()`: converts Correlates of War or Gleditsch-Ward state system membership data into dyad-year format.
- `filter_prd()`: filters dyad-year data frame to just "politically relevant" dyads.

It also has the following data sets:

- `capitals`: a list of capitals and capital transitions for Correlates of War state system members
- `ccode_democracy`: Correlates of War state-year data with three different estimates of democracy (Varieties of Democracy, Polity, Xavier Marquez/Pemstein et al.'s "(Quick) Unified Democracy Scores").
- `cow_alliance`: directed dyad-year alliance formation data from the Correlates of War
- `cow_contdir`: Correlates of War Direct Contiguity Data (v. 3.2)
- `cow_ddy`: a full directed dyad-year data frame of Correlates of War state system members
- `cow_gw_years`: a yearly data frame including information about Correlates of War and Gleditsch-Ward states.
- `cow_majors`: Correlates of War major powers data (version: 2016)
- `cow_states`: Correlates of War state system membership data (version: 2016)
- `gw_ddy`: a full directed dyad-year data frame of Gleditsch-Ward state system members
- `gw_states`: Gleditsch-Ward independent state system data (version: 2017)
- `maoz_powers`: Zeev Maoz' global/regional power data.

# Usage

The workflow is going to look something like this.

```{r, cache=F, message=F}

library(tidyverse, quietly = TRUE)
library(peacesciencer)
library(tictoc)

tic()
create_dyadyears() %>%
  # Add Gleditsch-Ward codes
  add_gwcode_to_cow() %>%
  # Add capital-to-capital distance
  add_capital_distance() %>%
  # Add contiguity information
  add_contiguity() %>%
  # Add major power data
  add_cow_majors() %>%
  # Add democracy variables
  add_democracy() %>%
  # add alliance data from Correlates of War
  add_cow_alliance() %>%
  # you should probably filter to politically relevant dyads earlier than later...
  # Or not, it's your time and computer processor...
  filter_prd()
toc()

# state-years now...

tic()
create_stateyears() %>%
  add_gwcode_to_cow() %>%
  add_capital_distance() %>%
  add_contiguity() %>%
  add_cow_majors() %>%
  add_democracy()
toc()

```
