`peacesciencer` is an R package including various functions and data sets to allow easier analyses in the field of quantitative peace science. The goal is to provide an R package that reasonably approximates what made [EUGene](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0738894211413055) so attractive to scholars working in the field of quantitative peace science in the early 2000s. EUGene shined because it encouraged replications of conflict models while having the user also generate data from scratch. Likewise, this R package will offer tools to approximate what EUGene did within the R environment (i.e. not requiring Windows for installation).

The package is very much a work in progress. Right now, it has the following functions:

- `add_capital_distance()`: adds capital-to-capital distance (in kilometers, "as the crow flies") to dyad-year or state-year data.
- `add_contiguity()`: adds Correlates of War direct contiguity data to dyad-year data.
- `add_cow_majors()`: adds Correlates of War major power information to dyad-year or state-year data.
- `create_stateyears()`: converts Correlates of War or Gleditsch-Ward state membership data into state-year format.
- `create_dyadyears()`: converts Correlates of War or Gleditsch-Ward state system membership data into dyad-year format.
- `filter_prd()`: filters dyad-year data frame to just "politically relevant" dyads.

It also has the following data sets:

- `capitals`: a list of capitals and capital transitions for Correlates of War state system members
- `cow_contdir`: Correlates of War Direct Contiguity Data (v. 3.2)
- `cow_ddy`: a full directed dyad-year data frame of Correlates of War state system members
- `cow_majors`: Correlates of War major powers data (version: 2016)
- `cow_states`: Correlates of War state system membership data (version: 2016)
- `gw_states`: Gleditsch-Ward independent state system data (version: 2017)
- `maoz_powers`: Zeev Maoz' global/regional power data.
