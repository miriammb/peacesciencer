`peacesciencer` is an R package including various functions and data sets to allow easier analyses in the field of quantitative peace science. The goal is to provide an R package that reasonably approximates what made [EUGene](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0738894211413055) so attractive to scholars working in the field of quantitative peace science in the early 2000s. EUGene shined because it encouraged replications of conflict models while having the user also generate data from scratch. Likewise, this R package will offer tools to approximate what EUGene did within the R environment (i.e. not requiring Windows for installation).

# Installation

You can install this on CRAN, as follows:

```r
install.packages("peacesciencer")

```

You can install the development version of this package through the `devtools` package. The development version of the package invariably has more goodies, but may or may not be at various levels of stress-testing.

```r
devtools::install_github("svmiller/peacesciencer")
```

# What's Included in `{peacesciencer}`

The package is already well developed and its functionality continues to expand. The current development version has the following functions.

```{r, echo=F, message=F, warning=F}
peacesciencer_functions <- tibble(x = as.vector(lsf.str("package:peacesciencer")))

db <- tools::Rd_db("peacesciencer")
db_names <- names(db)
db_descript <- lapply(db,function(x) {
    tags <- tools:::RdTags(x)
    if("\\description" %in% tags){
      out <- paste(unlist(x[which(tags=="\\description")]),collapse="")
    }
    else
      out <- NULL
    invisible(out)
  })

tibble(x = db_names, y = gsub("\n"," ",unlist(db_descript))) %>%
  mutate(x = str_sub(x, 1, nchar(x)-3)) %>%
  left_join(peacesciencer_functions, .) %>%
  mutate(func = paste0(x,"()")) -> peacesciencer_functions

peacesciencer_functions %>%
  mutate(link = paste0("[`",x,"()`](http://svmiller.com/peacesciencer/reference/",x,".html)")) -> peacesciencer_functions

tibble(`**Function**` = peacesciencer_functions$link,
       `**Description**` = peacesciencer_functions$y) %>%
  arrange(`**Function**`) %>%
  kable(., format="markdown")

```

The current development version also includes the following data.

```{r, echo=F, message=F, warning=F}
# library(tidyverse)
# library(kableExtra)
peacesciencer_data <- data(package = "peacesciencer")

object_name <- paste0("`",peacesciencer_data$results[, "Item"],"`")
object_link <- paste0("[",object_name,"](http://svmiller.com/peacesciencer/reference/",peacesciencer_data$results[, "Item"],".html)")

tibble(`**Object Name**` = object_link,
       `**Description**` = peacesciencer_data$results[, "Title"]) %>%
  arrange(`**Object Name**`) %>%
  kable(., format="markdown")

```

# How to Use `{peacesciencer}`

[`{peacesciencer}` has a user's guide](https://github.com/svmiller/peacesciencer/blob/master/user-guide/doc/ms.pdf) that is worth reading. The workflow is going to look something like this. This is a "tidy"-friendly approach to a data-generating process in quantitative peace science. 

First, start with one of two processes to create either dyad-year or state-year data. The dyad-year data are created with the `create_dyadyears()` function. It has a few optional parameters with hidden defaults. The user can specify what kind of state system (`system`) data they want to use---either Correlates of War (`"cow"`) or Gleditsch-Ward (`"gw"`), whether they want to extend the data to the most recently concluded calendar year (`mry`) (i.e. Correlates of War state system membership data are current as of Dec. 31, 2016 and the script can extend that to the end of the most recently concluded calendar year), and whether the user wants directed or non-directed dyad-year data (`directed`). 

The `create_stateyears()` works much the same way, though "directed" and "non-directed" make no sense in the state-year context. Both functions default to Correlates of War state system membership data to the most recently concluded calendar year.

Thereafter, the user can specify what additional variables they want added to these dyad-year or state-year data. Do note: the additional functions lean primarily on Correlates of War state code identifiers. Indeed, the bulk of the quantitative peace science data ecosystem is built around the Correlates of War project. The variables the user wants are added in [a "pipe"](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/pipes.html) in a process like this. Do note that the user may want to break up the data-generating process into a few manageable "chunks" (e.g. first generating dyad-year data and saving to an object, adding to it piece by piece).

All told, the process will look something like this. Assume you want to create some data for something analogous to a "dangerous dyads" design for all non-directed dyad-years. Here's how you'd do it in `{peacesciencer}`, which is going to be lifted from the source R scripts for the user's guide. The first part of this code chunk will lean on core `{peacesciencer}` functionality whereas the other stuff is some post-processing and, as a bonus, some modeling.

```{r, cache=F, message=F, eval=T}

#library(tidyverse)
#library(peacesciencer)
# library(stevemisc)
library(tictoc)

tic()
create_dyadyears(directed = FALSE, mry = FALSE) %>%
  filter_prd() %>%
  add_gml_mids(keep = NULL) %>%
  add_peace_years() %>%
  add_nmc() %>%
  add_democracy() %>%
  add_cow_alliance() %>%
  add_sdp_gdp() -> Data


Data %>%
  mutate(landcontig = ifelse(conttype == 1, 1, 0)) %>%
  mutate(cowmajdyad = ifelse(cowmaj1 == 1 | cowmaj2 == 1, 1, 0)) %>%
  # Create estimate of militarization as milper/tpop
  # Then make a weak-link
  mutate(milit1 = milper1/tpop1,
         milit2 = milper2/tpop2,
         minmilit = ifelse(milit1 > milit2,
                           milit2, milit1)) %>%
  # create CINC proportion (lower over higher)
  mutate(cincprop = ifelse(cinc1 > cinc2,
                           cinc2/cinc1, cinc1/cinc2)) %>%
  # create weak-link specification using Quick UDS data
  mutate(mindemest = ifelse(xm_qudsest1 > xm_qudsest2,
                            xm_qudsest2, xm_qudsest1)) %>%
  # Create "weak-link" measure of jointly advanced economies
  mutate(minwbgdppc = ifelse(wbgdppc2011est1 > wbgdppc2011est2,
                             wbgdppc2011est2, wbgdppc2011est1)) -> Data

# r2sd() is in {stevemisc}, a {peacesciencer} dependency.
Data %>%
  mutate_at(vars("cincprop", "mindemest", "minwbgdppc", "minmilit"),
            ~r2sd(.)) -> Data

summary(modDD <- glm(gmlmidonset ~ landcontig + cincprop + cowmajdyad + cow_defense +
               mindemest + minwbgdppc + minmilit +
               gmlmidspell + I(gmlmidspell^2) + I(gmlmidspell^3), data= Data,
             family=binomial(link="logit")))

```

Here is how you might do a standard civil conflict analysis using Gleditsch-Ward states and UCDP conflict data.

```{r, cache=F, message=F, eval=T}

tic()
create_stateyears(system = 'gw') %>%
  filter(year %in% c(1946:2019)) %>%
  add_ucdp_acd(type=c("intrastate"), only_wars = FALSE) %>%
  add_peace_years() %>%
  add_democracy() %>%
  add_creg_fractionalization() %>%
  add_sdp_gdp() %>%
  add_rugged_terrain() -> Data

create_stateyears(system = 'gw') %>%
  filter(year %in% c(1946:2019)) %>%
  add_ucdp_acd(type=c("intrastate"), only_wars = TRUE) %>%
  add_peace_years() %>%
  rename_at(vars(ucdpongoing:ucdpspell), ~paste0("war_", .)) %>%
  left_join(Data, .) -> Data




Data %>%
  arrange(gwcode, year) %>%
  group_by(gwcode) %>%
  mutate_at(vars("xm_qudsest", "wbgdppc2011est",
                 "wbpopest"), list(l1 = ~lag(., 1))) %>%
  rename_at(vars(contains("_l1")),
            ~paste("l1", gsub("_l1", "", .), sep = "_") ) -> Data


modCW <- list()
summary(modCW$"All UCDP Conflicts" <- glm(ucdponset ~ l1_wbgdppc2011est + l1_wbpopest  +
                    l1_xm_qudsest + I(l1_xm_qudsest^2) +
                    newlmtnest + ethfrac + relfrac +
                    ucdpspell + I(ucdpspell^2) + I(ucdpspell^3), data=subset(Data),
                  family = binomial(link="logit")))

summary(modCW$"Wars Only"  <- glm(war_ucdponset ~ l1_wbgdppc2011est + l1_wbpopest  +
                    l1_xm_qudsest + I(l1_xm_qudsest^2) +
